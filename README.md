# Decentralized Social Network Reputation Oracle

## Overview
This project implements a client-side simulation of a decentralized reputation system for social networks. It addresses one of the critical challenges in decentralized social platforms: establishing trust and combating malicious actors without centralized moderation.

The simulation demonstrates how a reputation algorithm can dynamically assess user credibility based on network interactions and behavior patterns, providing a foundation for self-regulating online communities.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Dynamic Reputation Algorithm**: Calculates user reputation scores based on:
  - Interaction frequency and types
  - Network effects (trust propagation)
  - Time decay of older interactions
- **Interactive Simulation**: Generate random interactions and observe how reputation scores evolve
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust key factors like time decay and trust propagation strength

### Visualization
- **User Rankings Table**: Sortable list of users and their reputation scores
- **Network Graph**: Interactive D3.js visualization showing connections between users
- **Color-Coded Interface**: Visual indicators of positive, neutral, and negative reputation

### User Interface
- **Real-time Updates**: See how reputation changes as new interactions occur
- **Time Step Control**: Simulate the passage of time and its effect on reputation
- **User Search**: Filter the user table to find specific network participants

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
- Users are represented as objects with:
  - Unique user IDs
  - Arrays of interaction objects
  - Calculated reputation scores
- Interactions include:
  - Type (post, comment, like, report)
  - Target user
  - Timestamp

### Reputation Algorithm
The algorithm considers multiple factors:

1. **Base Reputation Calculation**:
   - Each interaction has a weighted value (positive for likes, negative for reports)
   - Time decay reduces the impact of older interactions

2. **Trust Propagation**:
   - Users with high reputation have greater influence on others' scores
   - Positive interactions from respected users boost the target's reputation

3. **Normalization**:
   - Reputation scores are normalized to prevent extreme values
   - Final scores typically range from -5 (poor) to +5 (excellent)

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient graph rendering for smooth visualization
- Optimized reputation calculation for reasonable performance even with many users
- Caching of intermediate values to reduce redundant calculations

## Implementation

The entire application is implemented as a single HTML page with embedded JavaScript and CSS. The visualization uses the D3.js library for rendering the network graph.

### Key Components

1. **Data Generation**:
   ```javascript
   function generateUsers(numUsers) {
     const users = [];
     for (let i = 0; i < numUsers; i++) {
       users.push({
         userId: "user" + i,
         interactions: [],
         reputation: 0
       });
     }
     return users;
   }
   ```

2. **Reputation Calculation**:
   ```javascript
   function calculateReputations() {
     // Reset reputations
     users.forEach(user => {
       user.reputation = 0;
     });
     
     // Calculate base reputation from interactions
     users.forEach(user => {
       user.interactions.forEach(interaction => {
         const timeFactor = Math.exp(-timeDecayFactor * (currentTimeStep - interaction.timestamp) / 100);
         const weight = interactionWeights[interaction.type];
         user.reputation += weight * timeFactor;
       });
     });
     
     // Apply trust propagation
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Web3 and Decentralization Connection

This simulation addresses a fundamental challenge in Web3 ecosystems: establishing trust without central authorities. In a truly decentralized network:

- There is no central moderator to ban bad actors
- User reputation must emerge organically from network interactions
- Trust propagation provides a self-healing mechanism similar to how real communities function
- Temporal effects (like time decay) reflect how trust works in human relationships

While this is a simplified model, it demonstrates the core concepts that could be implemented in a blockchain-based social platform using smart contracts to store interaction data and calculate reputation scores in a transparent, tamper-resistant way.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `DRSS.html` in a modern web browser
3. Use the controls to adjust parameters and observe the simulation

No build process or server is required - the application runs entirely in the browser.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to explore:

- Implementing sybil resistance mechanisms
- Adding explicit "follow" relationships between users
- Creating more sophisticated reputation algorithms based on PageRank
- Adding reputation history tracking and visualization
- Implementing a simple content moderation system based on reputation scores
